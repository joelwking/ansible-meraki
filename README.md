# ansible-meraki
Ansible modules for Cisco Meraki cloud managed networks. This repo was created as sample code for training network engineers on how to use the Meraki APIs.

I encourage you to look at the playbook `meraki_provisioning.yml` for ideas of what Ansible modules need be developed and their respective arguments to provide additional functionality.
